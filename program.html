		<h3>Sessions Planned </h3>
		<p style="font-size: 1.6em;">Our current program has the following schedule.</p>
		<blockquote>Raga and Tala : A brief engagement with the audience for 30 minutes by playing different compositions and introducing the nuances of Indian Carnatic classical music and its historical journey through the courts of Indian kingdoms. We then highlight the design of machine learning and AI systems in analysis, synthesis, storage and distribution of music.
		</blockquote>

		<blockquote>Changing rivers and migrating elephants : The first session is a story of river Kaveri in India, its journey through human abuse and technology to aid in protecting the river. The next session would throw an insight into the world of Asian elephants and their perspective in the human-animal conflict and how the design of an IoT and AI platform in a forest setting with constrained infrastructure has aided understanding the conflict better.
		</blockquote>

		<h4>Venue</h4>
		<p style="font-size:1.2em">An auditorium or hall with a projector, sound system, network connectivity and could seat 30 to 40 people.
		We would also be interested if the venue is a pub or a cafe with the appropriate infrastructure. Sometimes, we could bring beer for the audience with some Indian snacks.</p>
