		<h3>An Upanyasa Session</h3>
		<p style="font-size:16.25px">Our sessions are planned for an hour on chosen themes. We introduce the concept for 15 minutes and next 30 minutes will be a journey through the theme and the different dimensions it may encompass. We will also have a QA session for 15 minutes. Post the Upanyasa, we open up the floor for interactions and collaborations accompanied by food and drinks. </p>
		<h4>Sessions Planned</h4>
		<p style="font-size: 1.2em;">Our current program has the following schedule.</p>
		<blockquote>Raga and Tala : A brief engagement with the audience for 30 minutes by playing different compositions and introducing the nuances of Indian Carnatic classical music and its historical journey through the courts of Indian kingdoms. We then review the design of AI systems in analysis, synthesis and distribution of music.
		</blockquote>

		<blockquote>Changing rivers and migrating elephants : The first session is a story of river Kaveri in India, its journey through human abuse and technology to aid in protecting the river. The next session would throw an insight into the world of Asian elephants and their perspective in the human-animal conflict and how the design of an IoT and AI platform in a forest setting with constrained infrastructure has aided understanding the conflict better.
		</blockquote>

		<h4>Venue</h4>
		<p style="font-size:1.2em">The program maybe conducted on request from a group or an interested party. An auditorium or hall with a projector, sound system, network connectivity and could seat 30 to 40 people is desirable.
		We would also be interested if the venue is a pub or a cafe with the above infrastructure. Sometimes, we could offer beverage and snacks.</p>
