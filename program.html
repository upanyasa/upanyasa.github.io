			<h3>Upanyasa</h3>
			<p style="font-size:16.25px">Upanyasa is an exposition, on a chosen theme with the following sequence:  Introduction, followed by presentation and/or a performance, and a QA session on the theme, for about an hour. Post session, we open the floor for free interactions and collaborations accompanied by food and drinks.</p>
			<h4>Current Themes</h4>
			<blockquote><b>Raga and Laya</b>: A brief introduction to Indian Carnatic classical music and its nuances covering its historical journey encompassing its origins, development, composers, musicology, etc. We then present trends in analysis, synthesis and distribution of music.
			</blockquote>

			<blockquote><b>Changing rivers and wandering elephants</b>: The first part is a story of river Kaveri in South India, its passage through human abuse as also the use of technology to aid its protection. The Second part is an insight into the world of Indian elephants and perspectives in the human-animal conflict highlighting how an IoT and AI platform in a forest with constrained infrastructure has aided understanding the conflict better.
