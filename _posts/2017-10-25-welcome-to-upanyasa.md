<!-- You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll’s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll’s dedicated Help repository][jekyll-help].

Coming Soon in your neighbourhood! P.S. There needs to be a brewery around.

<!-- They say that all great things begin with an idea. In our case, the idea was Upanyasa. It has been a few months since we first conceived Upanyasa and since then, we have been toiling hard to make it a reality. This was soon a reality when we had first Upanyasa events at Ramaiah Institute of Technology, an engineering school on 24th of October and PES University on 25th of October, 2017. 

Organizing Upanyasa at these universities was the perfect way to start our journey. Our audience was from different departments like computer science, electronics, communications, architecture and others. But, all shared interests with the themes that we were discussing. In both these events, we talked about our experiences in Human-Animal Conflict. We demonstrated the way we have used technology in wildlife setting. 

Here are some of the glimpses from our events -

In conclusion, the event was greatly received by the participants. We are all excited and geared up for our next Upanyasa at University of Twente.
