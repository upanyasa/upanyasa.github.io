		<h4>How do you set up an Event?</h4>
		<p style="font-size:1.2em">We arrange a few events on our own in venues and locations that we have access to. The event may also be conducted on request from an interested group or organization. </p>

		<h4>Venue</h4>
		<p style="font-size:1.2em">A hall with a seating capacity of 30 to 40 that contains a projector, a public address system, and network connectivity is required. We will also be happy to conduct the event in a pub or a cafe with the above infrastructure.</p>
